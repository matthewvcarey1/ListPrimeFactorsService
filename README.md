# ListPrimeFactorsService

A very silly service that very quickly finds the Prime Factors of numbers in a limited range. It uses far too much memory as it reads a large list of Primes into Memory at launch.

It is a Gradle Springboot java program. It is based on the earlier java standalone commandline program.

I have tidied up the original routines to make them more in line with the "Functional" use of Java.

It can handle a large amount of simultaneous queries on powerful enough hardware.

The datafile of primes that I used for this application is too large to put on github, I will tidy up the application that I wrote it with and put that in its own repository.
